# How to Intall

Python 3 should be already installed.
Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install
 dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclop
edia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.
